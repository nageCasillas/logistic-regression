# logistic-regression
A repository for experimenting with linear regression and building a project based on it.

## About

This project focuses on building, experimenting with, and visualizing linear regression models, including **basic Linear Regression**, **Lasso Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, and **Elastic Net Regression**. Using the **Algerian Forest Fires Dataset** available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitinchoudhary012/algerian-forest-fires-dataset), this project explores how these models can predict outcomes related to forest fires.

The user interface is built with **Streamlit** to provide a simple, interactive experience for selecting and comparing regression models.
